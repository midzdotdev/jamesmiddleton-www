[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0e25f371-b764-4579-ab79-aa13fcdffc97/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/jamesmiddleton/deploys)

Personal website with a CTA to book time with me as a consultant.

## Tech
* created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (which relies on [React](https://reactjs.org/))
* styles provided by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* deploys automatically onto [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

*I'm aware that using Next.js is a bit overkill here, but it's nice to use and keeps the site extensible moving forward.*
